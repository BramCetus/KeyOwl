# KeyOwl
KeyOwl is a keylogger. Once KeyOwl is run it creates a startup shortcut and then makes a log.txt file where it will store all 
the keystrokes. 

Every time KeyOwl is run, it will encrypt the content of the log.txt file and send it to you via e-mail.

You can also use pyinstaller to convert KeyOwl to an .exe file.
